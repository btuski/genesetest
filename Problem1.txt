Fibonacci series is the sequential order of numbers in which the first two numbers may be 1 and 1 or 0 and 1. Depending upon the numbers the series begin and the subsequent number is the sum of previous two numbers, the resulting nth term is the sum of (n-1)th term and (n-2)th term.

Algorithm for Problem1

1. Start
2. Declare the variables n, x, y, temp
3. Initialize the variables
   3.1 x = 1,
   3.2 y = 2
   3.3 temp = 0
4. Enter the numbers of term to be printed in Fibonacci Series
5. Print the First two terms of series
6. Use Loop to print the terms of given fibonacci series in which the value of nth term is less than 4 million
   6.1 temp = x + y
   6.2 x = y
   6.3 y = temp
   6.4 now increment i each time by 1
   6.5 print the value of temp
7. after printing the value of series
   7.1 check the even terms in the series
   7.2 calculate the sum of even terms
   7.3 print the sum
8. End
